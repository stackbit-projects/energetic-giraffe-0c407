Installing SGDS
---------------

* * *

### Install directly in browsers using a free and highly available CDN:

#### CSS

{% highlight html %} ...    ... {% endhighlight %}

#### JavaScript

[Certain components](/docs/) of SGDS make use of JavaScript, with jQuery as an external dependency. **If you only need the visual parts of SGDS (i.e. css), you do not need to import the following.**

{% highlight html %} ... ... {% endhighlight %}

* * *

### Install using npm

Frontend developers can use npm to download sgds and use it as a dependency in their projects. Using npm is especially useful when using a module bundler or build tool, such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org).

*   Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which includes an installation of npm.
*   Install sgds by navigating to your site's codebase folder using your terminal and run: `npm install sgds-govtech`
*   This will download sgds into `node_modules/sgds-govtech` in your current folder: {%- highlight bash -%} site/node\_modules/sgds-govtech/ ├── css/ ├── fonts/ ├── js/ ├── \* sgds/sass/ {%- endhighlight -%} _\* SGDS Sass source files, for [advanced usage](/docs/customise-sgds)._
*   If you use a module bundler like Webpack, import sgds in your entry point: {% highlight javascript %} import "sgds-govtech/css/sgds.css"; import "sgds-govtech/js/sgds"; // Do not use with other web frameworks! {% endhighlight %} _\*Note that usage with frameworks such as React, Vue or Angular is discouraged since they manipulate the DOM in their own environments. Framework-specific implementations are in early development and can be found at [sgds-govtech-react](https://github.com/govtechsg/sgds-govtech-react) and [sgds-govtech-vue](https://github.com/govtechsg/sgds-govtech-vue) ._

* * *

### Install manually

You can download minified sgds CSS and JavaScript files and host them yourself in your production environment.

[Download SGDS package](/assets/downloads/sgds-govtech.zip)

The zip package contains the following files:

`css/sgds.css`

`fonts/sgds-icons.svg`

`fonts/sgds-icons.wott`

`fonts/sgds-icons.ttf`

`sgds/sass/...`(source files for [advanced usage](/docs/customise-sgds))

*   Extract and copy the files and folders into a relevant place in your project’s code base
*   Reference the CSS and JavaScript files in each HTML page or templates in your project, same as above. Note that [certain components](/docs/) of SGDS make use of JavaScript, with jQuery as an external dependency. {%- highlight html -%} ...  ...    {%- endhighlight -%}

* * *
