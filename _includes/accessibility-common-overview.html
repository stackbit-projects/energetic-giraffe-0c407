<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
    As we continue to build and develop products for Singapore, we want
    to ensure that no one is left behind. Whether it means including
    video captions to help people with hearing difficulties,
    ensuring legibility of content through high-contrast text,
    or even presenting information in an understandable manner.
    Designing for accessibility means your digital products
    can be used and enjoyed by the majority.
