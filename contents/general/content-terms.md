Licence Terms and Restrictions
------------------------------

*   The Service, including the materials made available on or through the Service, is owned by, licensed to, managed or controlled by GovTech. Please see clause 4 (Third Party Materials) for more information.
    
*   Subject to these Terms of Use, GovTech grants to you a non-exclusive and non-transferable right to access and use the Service for personal or internal purposes only. You shall not, amongst other things, modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, adapt, publish, redistribute or sublicense the Service or any part of the Service without the prior written consent of GovTech or the respective third party owners.
    
*   GovTech reserves the right to:
    
    *   Update or modify this Service from time to time;
    *   Deny or restrict access to or use of the Service by any particular person without ascribing any reasons whatsoever; and
    *   Discontinue this Service at any time without notice or liability to you whatsoever, whereupon all rights granted to you hereunder shall also terminate forthwith. You shall further upon notice from GovTech return or destroy all copies of the Service or materials therein that you may have downloaded.

Third Party Materials
---------------------

*   The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of software or services of a third party (“Third Party”). In such an event, there will be terms of use of the third party software or service (the “Third Party Terms”) that will bind either GovTech or you or both. An example of Third Party Terms may be open source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the distribution platform (the “Distribution Terms”). Information on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms) or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein. For the avoidance of doubt, insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service. For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store, then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.
    
*   You are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms. In particular, you are deemed to have notice of any terms that GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party Terms which are applicable to you as the end user.
    
*   If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms.
    
*   If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated (the “Incorporated Terms”). Examples of Incorporated Terms include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge certain matters.
    
*   Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights of enforcement against you.
    
*   You agree to indemnify and keep GovTech harmless against all claims, actions, liabilities, losses, damages, costs or expenses (including legal costs on an indemnity basis) howsoever arising out of or in connection with your access or use of the aforesaid third party software or services or your non-compliance with the Third Party Terms or Incorporated Terms which causes GovTech to breach any of the Third Party Terms.
    
*   For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.
